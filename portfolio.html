        <p> Here are a few of the projects I have completed. </p>
        <h3 element class="overline_text">Graph ADT</h3>
        <p> This is a project about developing a Graph Abstract Data Type through C++. The project
            was developed in a team of two. It was an exercise in and Object Oriented Programming 
            and Algorithm Analysis. The following image is pictoral representation of the data structure. </p>

        <h3 element class="overline_text">Aggie Shell</h3>
        <p> This project was an exercise in implementing a Linux shell through C++. Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run Linux commands as child processes</li>
            <li>Inter-process communication</li>
            <li>Navigate through the file system</li>
            <li>File input/out redirection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The shell has the ability to function almost as well as BASH. It runs Linux commands 
            that sit as executables in the system through a a call to execvp().</p>
