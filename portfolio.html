                <p style="font-size: largex;"> As part of an exercise in Object-Oriented Programming and Algorithm Analysis, me and my team developed a Graph Abstract Data Type using C++. The project was a hands-on demonstration of our ability to design, develop, and implement a complex data structure.
                    We utilized Dijkstra's Algorithm to compute the shortest path between a chosen root vertex and every other vertex in the graph. This not only showcased an understanding of algorithmic design but also demonstrated our ability to choose the right algorithm for the task at hand.
                    The use of C++ in the project highlights my proficiency in this popular programming language, as well as my ability to write efficient and optimized code. The Object-Oriented Programming approach I took in designing the Graph Abstract Data Type shows my ability to design scalable, modular, and maintainable code.
                    Our team's success in delivering a fully functional Graph Abstract Data Type is a testament to hour of coding and debugging we spent. The project was an opportunity for me to demonstrate your skills in problem-solving, coding, and working in a team. My contribution to the project reflects your commitment to growing your technical abilities and your drive to produce high-quality results.

                <p style="font-size: large;"> <p> This project was an exercise in implementing a Linux shell through C++. Features:</p>
                I recently completed a project that was an exercise in implementing a Linux shell using C++. This project showcases my proficiency in the C++ programming language and my understanding of operating system concepts.
                One of the key features of the shell was the ability to run Linux commands as child processes, enabling the shell to perform complex operations. The implementation of inter-process communication allowed for seamless communication between the shell and the child processes, resulting in efficient and accurate execution of commands.
                In addition, the shell provided the ability to navigate through the file system and perform file input/output redirection. This demonstrated my understanding of how to interact with the file system and manage data streams in a shell environment.
                The shell was designed to function almost as well as BASH, the standard shell on most Linux systems. The use of execvp() to run Linux commands that sit as executables in the system demonstrates my understanding of the underlying system calls used to execute commands.
                Overall, the Linux shell project is a testament to my technical abilities and my passion for programming. My ability to design, implement, and deliver a functional Linux shell that is capable of running Linux commands and providing a rich set of features highlights my skills in software development and problem-solving.
